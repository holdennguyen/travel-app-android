# Progress: Travel App Android

## What Currently Works
- ✅ Basic Android project structure initialized
- ✅ Gradle build system configured with Kotlin DSL
- ✅ Standard Android project files in place
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation system established
- ✅ **ViewBinding enabled** for type-safe view management
- ✅ **Chip Navigation Bar** integrated for modern bottom navigation
- ✅ **ViewPager2** added for swipeable page navigation
- ✅ **Glide** integrated for image loading and caching
- ✅ **Custom color palette** established (purple, darkBlue, lightGray)
- ✅ **Comprehensive UI resources** - backgrounds, drawables, travel icons
- ✅ **Multi-density icon support** for all screen densities
- ✅ **IDE configuration** updated for Java 21 and proper modules
- ✅ **Travel-focused icon library** ready for implementation

## What's Left to Build
- [ ] Define specific travel app features and user stories
- [ ] ~~Set up project dependencies~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Design application architecture (MVVM with ViewBinding)
- [ ] Create main activity and navigation structure
- [ ] Implement core screens (home, search, bookings, profile)
- [ ] Set up data models and repositories
- [ ] Add data persistence (Room database)
- [ ] Integrate travel APIs (if needed)
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Prepare for deployment

## Current Status
**Phase**: UI Foundation Setup (Complete) ✅
**Next Phase**: Architecture Planning and Core Feature Implementation

## Known Issues
*None identified at this time*

## Recent Completed Tasks
- ✅ Set up comprehensive UI framework with ViewBinding
- ✅ Added modern navigation library (Chip Navigation Bar)
- ✅ Integrated image loading capabilities with Glide
- ✅ Created custom design system with travel-focused colors
- ✅ Added complete icon library for travel app features
- ✅ Configured multi-density support for all Android devices
- ✅ Updated IDE configuration for optimal development

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Architecture Phase**: Define MVVM structure with ViewBinding
2. **Core Screens Phase**: Implement main navigation and key screens
3. **Data Layer Phase**: Add models, repositories, and persistence
4. **Feature Implementation Phase**: Build travel-specific functionality
5. **Testing Phase**: Add comprehensive testing
6. **Polish Phase**: UI refinement and performance optimization
7. **Deployment Phase**: Prepare for release

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Setup**: Chose Kotlin Gradle DSL for build scripts
- **Documentation**: Implemented Memory Bank system for session continuity
- **Project Structure**: Maintained standard Android conventions
- **UI Framework**: Adopted ViewBinding for type-safe view management
- **Navigation**: Selected Chip Navigation Bar for modern UX
- **Image Loading**: Integrated Glide for robust image handling
- **Design System**: Created purple/blue travel app color scheme
- **Icon Strategy**: Comprehensive multi-density icon library

## Technical Debt
*None identified at this early stage*

## Performance Considerations
- ViewBinding reduces findViewById() overhead
- Glide provides efficient image loading and caching
- Multi-density icons ensure optimal display across devices
