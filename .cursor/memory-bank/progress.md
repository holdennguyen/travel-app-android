## What's Left to Build
- [ ] ~~Define specific travel app features and user stories~~ âœ… **IMPLIED BY DATABASE STRUCTURE**
- [ ] ~~Set up project dependencies~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [ ] ~~Set up backend infrastructure~~ âœ… **COMPLETED - Firebase + Cloudinary**
- [ ] ~~Add Firebase SDK to Android app~~ âœ… **COMPLETED - SDK 21.0.0 Integrated**
- [ ] Create Firebase data models and repositories (MVVM implementation)
- [ ] Design application architecture (MVVM with ViewBinding + Firebase)
- [ ] Create main activity and navigation structure  
- [ ] Implement core screens with real Firebase data (home, search, bookings, profile)
- [ ] Integrate Cloudinary images with Glide for seamless loading
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Prepare for deployment

## Current Status
**Phase**: Firebase SDK Integration (Complete) âœ…
**Next Phase**: Data Models & Repository Implementation

## Known Issues
*None identified at this time*

3. **ViewModel Integration**: Connect Firebase data to UI with MVVM architecture
4. **Core Screens Phase**: Implement main navigation with real Firebase data
5. **Image Integration Phase**: Connect Cloudinary images with Glide seamlessly
6. **Feature Implementation Phase**: Build travel-specific functionality with live data
7. **Testing Phase**: Add comprehensive testing for Firebase integration
8. **Polish Phase**: UI refinement and performance optimization
9. **Deployment Phase**: Prepare for release with Firebase production setup

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Setup**: Chose Kotlin Gradle DSL for build scripts
- **Documentation**: Implemented Memory Bank system for session continuity
- **Project Structure**: Maintained standard Android conventions
- **UI Framework**: Adopted ViewBinding for type-safe view management
- **Navigation**: Selected Chip Navigation Bar for modern UX
- **Image Loading**: Integrated Glide for robust image handling
- **Design System**: Created purple/blue travel app color scheme
- **Icon Strategy**: Comprehensive multi-density icon library
- **Documentation Workflow**: Established mandatory Memory Bank updates after every commit
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Backend Architecture**: Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data sync
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Image Management**: Cloudinary CDN for professional image delivery
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Full-Stack Integration**: Complete backend infrastructure before app implementation
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Firebase SDK**: Direct Android integration with version catalog management

## Technical Debt
*None identified at this early stage*

## Performance Considerations
- ViewBinding reduces findViewById() overhead
- Glide provides efficient image loading and caching (perfect for Cloudinary)
- Multi-density icons ensure optimal display across devices
- Firebase Realtime Database provides real-time sync with offline support
- Cloudinary CDN ensures fast, optimized image delivery globally
- Firebase SDK 21.0.0 includes latest performance optimizations
