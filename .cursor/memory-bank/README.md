## Usage Guidelines

### At Session Start
1. **Always** read ALL core files before beginning work
2. Focus on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for current state
3. Review `projectbrief.md` to understand project foundation

### During Work
1. Document decisions and patterns as they emerge
2. Update `activeContext.md` with progress and insights
3. Note any architectural decisions in `systemPatterns.md`

### When Requested "update memory bank"
1. **Must** review ALL files, even if unchanged
2. Focus particularly on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`
3. Document current state, insights, and next steps

## Project Status
- **Created**: During initial project setup
- **Current Phase**: Project initialization complete, ready for planning
- **Next Steps**: Define travel app requirements and features

## Key Reminders
- This is a fresh Android project with no custom features yet
- Memory Bank system is now established for session continuity
- All core documentation files are in place and ready for updates
