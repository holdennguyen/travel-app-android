# Active Context: Travel App Android

## Current Work Focus
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Firebase SDK Integration** (COMPLETED) - Android app connected to Firebase
- **Data Models & Repositories** - Next phase implementation
- **Real Data Implementation** - Connect app screens to Firebase database
- Core screen development with live Firebase data

## Recent Changes
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Firebase SDK Integration** - Android Firebase dependencies added and configured
  - **Firebase Database SDK**: `firebase-database:21.0.0` integrated
  - **Google Services Plugin**: `google-gms-google-services:4.4.3` configured
  - **Firebase Configuration**: `app/google-services.json` added to project
  - **Database File**: `database.json` present for import
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Firebase Realtime Database** - Connected and database.json imported (backend)
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Cloudinary Integration** - Image assets uploaded and managed via CDN
  - **Account**: holdennguyen6174@gmail.com
  - **Folder**: "travel-app-android" in media library
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Backend-Cloud Sync** - Firebase database updated with Cloudinary banner links
- **Repository Setup**: JitPack repository added for Chip Navigation Bar dependency
- **UI Framework Setup**: Added ViewBinding for efficient view management
- **Navigation Library**: Integrated Chip Navigation Bar for modern bottom navigation  
- **UI Components**: Added ViewPager2 for swipeable page navigation
- **Image Handling**: Integrated Glide for image loading and caching
- **Design System**: Created custom color palette (purple, darkBlue, lightGray)
- **UI Resources**: Added comprehensive drawable backgrounds and travel-related icons
- **Multi-density Support**: Complete icon set for all screen densities (ldpi to xxxhdpi)
- **IDE Configuration**: Updated for Java 21 and proper module structure

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Create Firebase data models** - Define data classes for travel app entities
2. **Implement Repository pattern** - Abstract Firebase database access
3. **Set up ViewModels** - Connect Firebase data to UI with MVVM
4. **Create main activity and navigation structure**
5. **Implement core screens with real Firebase data** (home, search, bookings, profile)
6. **Integrate Cloudinary images** from "travel-app-android" folder with Glide

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Firebase SDK Complete**: Android app now has direct Firebase Realtime Database access
- **Version Management**: Using version catalog for Firebase dependencies (21.0.0)
- **Google Services**: Proper Firebase configuration with google-services.json
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Chosen for real-time data sync across devices
- **Cloudinary**: Selected for professional image management and CDN delivery
- **Cloudinary Organization**: All images organized in dedicated "travel-app-android" folder
- **Architecture Ready**: Complete backend + Android SDK enables MVVM implementation
- **ViewBinding**: Chosen for type-safe view references and better performance
- **Chip Navigation**: Selected for modern, intuitive bottom navigation UX
- **Glide**: Perfect for loading Cloudinary images efficiently

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **ðŸ”¥ Firebase SDK Pattern**: Direct Android Firebase integration with proper configuration
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time database with offline support
- **Cloudinary CDN**: Professional image delivery with optimization from organized folder structure
- **Backend-Frontend Sync**: Database links to cloud images for complete data
- **ViewBinding Pattern**: Type-safe view access without findViewById()
- **Modern Navigation**: Bottom navigation with chip-style indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Multi-density icon support for all devices
- **Travel-focused UI**: Icons and styling tailored for travel app use cases
- **ðŸ”¥ MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: After every commit, Memory Bank must be reviewed and updated with significant changes
- **Documentation-First**: All architectural and technical decisions must be captured immediately

## Current Learnings and Project Insights
