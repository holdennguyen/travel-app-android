# Active Context: Travel App Android

## Current Work Focus
- UI foundation and development dependencies setup (COMPLETED)
- Travel app architecture planning
- Core feature implementation preparation

## Recent Changes
- **UI Framework Setup**: Added ViewBinding for efficient view management
- **Navigation Library**: Integrated Chip Navigation Bar for modern bottom navigation
- **UI Components**: Added ViewPager2 for swipeable page navigation
- **Image Handling**: Integrated Glide for image loading and caching
- **Design System**: Created custom color palette (purple, darkBlue, lightGray)
- **UI Resources**: Added comprehensive drawable backgrounds and travel-related icons
- **Multi-density Support**: Complete icon set for all screen densities (ldpi to xxxhdpi)
- **IDE Configuration**: Updated for Java 21 and proper module structure

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Define specific travel app features and user stories
2. Plan application architecture (likely MVVM with ViewBinding)
3. Create main activity and navigation structure
4. Implement core screens (home, search, bookings, profile)
5. Set up data models and repositories

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **ViewBinding**: Chosen for type-safe view references and better performance
- **Chip Navigation**: Selected for modern, intuitive bottom navigation UX
- **Glide**: Adopted for robust image loading in travel app contexts
- **Custom Color Scheme**: Purple/blue theme for travel app branding

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **ViewBinding Pattern**: Type-safe view access without findViewById()
- **Modern Navigation**: Bottom navigation with chip-style indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Multi-density icon support for all devices
- **Travel-focused UI**: Icons and styling tailored for travel app use cases
- **ðŸ”¥ MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: After every commit, Memory Bank must be reviewed and updated with significant changes
- **Documentation-First**: All architectural and technical decisions must be captured immediately

## Current Learnings and Project Insights
- **UI Foundation Complete**: All essential UI libraries and resources in place
- **Professional Setup**: Comprehensive icon library and styling system ready
- **Architecture Ready**: ViewBinding enables clean MVVM implementation
- **Travel App Focus**: Icon set suggests booking, navigation, and travel features
- **Memory Bank Workflow**: Established mandatory process for maintaining documentation accuracy

## Blockers/Issues
*None identified at this time*

## Context for Next Session
- UI framework and dependencies are fully established
- Ready to begin implementing travel app screens and functionality
- Architecture decisions (ViewBinding, navigation) are in place
- Custom styling and icon library available for immediate use
- Memory Bank workflow established to ensure continuity between sessions
