# Active Context: Travel App Android

## Current Work Focus
- **Backend Integration** (COMPLETED) - Firebase Realtime Database + Cloudinary
- **Data Architecture** (COMPLETED) - Database imported with cloud image links
- **Full-Stack Foundation** (COMPLETED) - Complete backend infrastructure ready
- Travel app feature implementation with real data

## Recent Changes
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Firebase Realtime Database** - Connected and database.json imported
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Cloudinary Integration** - Image assets uploaded and managed via CDN
  - **Account**: holdennguyen6174@gmail.com
  - **Folder**: "travel-app-android" in media library
- **ðŸ”¥ MAJOR: Backend-Cloud Sync** - Firebase database updated with Cloudinary banner links
- **UI Framework Setup**: Added ViewBinding for efficient view management
- **Navigation Library**: Integrated Chip Navigation Bar for modern bottom navigation
- **UI Components**: Added ViewPager2 for swipeable page navigation
- **Image Handling**: Integrated Glide for image loading and caching
- **Design System**: Created custom color palette (purple, darkBlue, lightGray)
- **UI Resources**: Added comprehensive drawable backgrounds and travel-related icons
- **Multi-density Support**: Complete icon set for all screen densities (ldpi to xxxhdpi)
- **IDE Configuration**: Updated for Java 21 and proper module structure

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Connect Firebase to Android app (add Firebase SDK dependencies)
2. Implement Firebase data models and repositories
3. Create main activity with navigation structure
4. Implement core screens with real Firebase data (home, search, bookings, profile)
5. Integrate Cloudinary images from "travel-app-android" folder with Glide for seamless loading

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Chosen for real-time data sync across devices
- **Cloudinary**: Selected for professional image management and CDN delivery
- **Cloudinary Organization**: All images organized in dedicated "travel-app-android" folder
- **Backend-First Integration**: Database and images established before UI implementation
- **ViewBinding**: Chosen for type-safe view references and better performance
- **Chip Navigation**: Selected for modern, intuitive bottom navigation UX
- **Glide**: Perfect for loading Cloudinary images efficiently

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time database with offline support
- **Cloudinary CDN**: Professional image delivery with optimization from organized folder structure
- **Backend-Frontend Sync**: Database links to cloud images for complete data
- **ViewBinding Pattern**: Type-safe view access without findViewById()
- **Modern Navigation**: Bottom navigation with chip-style indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Multi-density icon support for all devices
- **Travel-focused UI**: Icons and styling tailored for travel app use cases
- **ðŸ”¥ MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: After every commit, Memory Bank must be reviewed and updated with significant changes
- **Documentation-First**: All architectural and technical decisions must be captured immediately

## Current Learnings and Project Insights
- **Complete Backend Infrastructure**: Firebase + Cloudinary provides full-stack foundation
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Firebase enables live data sync across devices
- **Professional Image Management**: Cloudinary CDN with organized folder structure ensures fast, optimized image delivery
- **Architecture Ready**: Backend + ViewBinding enables clean MVVM implementation
- **Travel App Focus**: Database structure and images support travel app features
- **Memory Bank Workflow**: Established mandatory process for maintaining documentation accuracy
